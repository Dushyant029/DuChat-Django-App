## The Problem it solves ☮️
CHAT Community: DuChat is a messaging app that allows you to chat, connect, and collaborate with friends, family, and colleagues. DuChat helps you stay connected with your loved ones through seamless messaging. Whether it's chatting with friends, staying in touch with family, or collaborating with colleagues, DuChat makes communication easy and convenient.

## Challenges we ran into 🕊️
We faced numerous challenges throughout the journey. But we all were new to it. Sometimes it is the connection issues and sometimes it’s our lack of experience in integration feature. It took a lot of time to overcome this issue. After this we have faced issues while writing codes for responsive design. Sometimes the components were distorted and moved from their places. It took time to place them in their right position. Placing the elements in their position and designing for responsiveness was our big challenge.

    * Messaging: WebSockets enable real-time messaging without constant page refreshes.
    * Efficient Integration: Django Channels handles WebSocket connections and dispatches events to consumers.
    * Event Handling: Consumers process events and broadcast messages to connected clients.
    * Rapid Development: Django's features and Tailwind's utility classes streamline development.
    * Real-Time Capabilities: WebSockets enable seamless chat experiences.
    * Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns and Django's structure enhance maintainability.
    * Scalability: Django and Channels can handle large-scale applications.

## How we built it!?🧠
We used Django stack, Tailwind CSS for forms, contents and for some components like buttons and illustrations for our website. We used undraw website for some of the illustrations. We used AWS services and used Gmeet for further discussions on content and screens. We used look a to design logo for our app.

    * Establish a platform that encourages interaction among individuals with various hobbies.

    * Create a user-friendly and engaging environment for community building.
